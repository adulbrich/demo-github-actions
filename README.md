# GitHub Actions Demo

This repository aims at illustrating various use of GitHub Actions to build and publish a static website.

The project uses Astro.

## Workflows

GitHub Actions workflow are located in `.github/workflows/`.

We cover the following use cases:

1. Deploy the site to GitHub Pages
2. Deploy the site to AWS S3 (todo)
3. Deploy the site to AWS EC2 (todo)

## Astro Information

### Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### Astro Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
